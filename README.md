# Proof of Concept

Proof of concept for the Whiteboard Project Proposal: Local Air Quality Monitor. For now creates a GUI, takes user input, creates spreadsheet, and puts input in spreadsheet.
Ultimate goal is to take in user location info, make call to OpenWeatherMap API, get local air quality index data, and display data and give option to put it in spreadsheet in GUI.
